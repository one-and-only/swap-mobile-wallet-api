# swap-mobile-wallet-api
API for the Swap mobile wallets (by me). This serves as a workaround to the limitations of React Native and its JS VM. It doesn't have access to all of the core node modules and can sometimes be detected as a browser and not a Node.js environment. Running pure Node.js should solve this issue.
